This is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe,
also known as Noughts and Crosses. The game is played on a 3x3 grid,
where two players, X and O, take turns marking a square. 

The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) 
wins the game. If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
